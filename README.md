This is my first data science project, realized in the frame of the IBM data science certificate. The goal was to predict if the first stage of a SpaceX rocket will succesfully land. There are different steps:

1. Data collection with SpaceX API
2. Webscraping on wikipedia using BeautifulSoup
3. Data wrangling
4. Data analysis
5. Data analysis using SQL
6. Interactive map visualization with folium
7. Interactive dashboard vizualisation with Plotly
8. Machine learning prediction (SVM, KNN, logistic regression, decision tree) and model evaluation
